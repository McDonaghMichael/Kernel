# Kernel

This is a side-project working on creating a Kernel, purely to learn how computers work at a very fundamental level, exploring different concepts, and mostly just for the fun of it!

Nothing serious but diving deep into the very structure under the OS is very interesting! 

Especially as it helps me understand memory buffers, ASM and other low level concepts.
